| multiaddr | string  | yes      | Multiaddress generated by client                    |

Expected response from server:

```
{
	"shareId": "1AbhoECj"
}
```

#### pulse

Pulse action meant to make maintaining the connection and the sharing session valid and possible by rapidly sending a packet to server to report the `Alive` state of the client. By doing this, server will store the session and shareId while the clients are alive, if a client stopped to send a packet, server will delete the related shareId and multiaddr it announced before. (**Default expiration time will be 5 minutes**)

If sending is successful, a [pulseReceived](#pulseReceived) object is returned.

**POST** /pulse

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description                                                  |

}
```
