## API Documentation

### Actions

#### announce

Announce action relates to the first connection from peer to server, within this action, a client send three parameters to tracker server in order to record and make the share action possible.

If sending is successful, an [announceReceived](#announceReceived) object will be returned.

| Field  | Type   | Required | Description             |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| action | string | yes      | Fixed value, "announce" |

Expected response from server:

```json
{
  "action": "announceReceived",
  "data": {
    "shareId": "1AbhoECj"
  }
}
```

#### pulse

Pulse action meant to make maintaining the connection and the sharing session valid and possible by rapidly sending a packet to server to report the `Alive` state of the client. By doing this, server will store the session and shareId while the clients are alive, if a client stopped to send a packet, server will delete the related shareId and multiaddr it announced before. (**Default expiration time will be 5 minutes**)

If sending is successful, a [pulseReceived](#pulseReceived) object is returned.

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| action    | string  | yes      | Fixed value, "pulse"                                         |
| override  | boolean | optional | If set to `true`, the following data in this body object will be  updated to server, default is `false` |
| ip        | string  | optional | Based on override param, server will update the ip address according to the given one |
| port      | string  | optional | Based on override param, server will update the port mapping according to the given one |
| multiaddr | string  | optional | Based on override param, server will update the port mapping according to the given one |
| shareId   | boolean | optional | If set to `true`, server will regenerate a shareId to client |

Expected response from server:

```json
{
  "action": "pulseReceived",
  "data": {
    "status": "0",
    "overriden": "false"
  }
}
```

#### push

Push action tells the server the unique shareId of the target client the peers shared. Tracker server respond with the `IP:Port` back to the requesting client, so on, the client can try to establish the connection between. 

If sending is successful, a [pushReceived](#pushReceived) is returned.

| Field   | Type   | Required | Description                                                  |

| action  | string | yes      | Fixed value, "push"                                          |
| shareId | string | yes      | The unique shareId from other client, this shareId can  be get through [announce](#announce) method or [pulse](#pulse) method with override set to `true` |

Expected response from server:

```json
{
  "action": "pushReceived",
  "data": {
    "peeraddr": "1.2.3.4:23333"
  }
}
```
